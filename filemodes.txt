What is a File?
  A file is a named location on disk to store related information. It is used to store data permanently so that it can be retrieved and manipulated as needed.
 In computing, files are managed by the operating system and can be of different types such as text files, binary files, and more.

Different Modes of File in Python
When working with files in Python, you can specify different modes to open a file, which determine the operations you can perform on the file. Here are the common file modes:

1.Read ('r'):

Opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, an error occurs.
Example: open('file.txt', 'r')

2.Write ('w'):

Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its content is truncated (deleted). If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.txt', 'w')

3.Append ('a'):

Opens the file for appending. Data is added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.txt', 'a')

4.Read and Write ('r+'):

Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.
Example: open('file.txt', 'r+')

5.Write and Read ('w+'):

Opens the file for both writing and reading. If the file exists, its content is truncated. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.txt', 'w+')

6.Append and Read ('a+'):

Opens the file for both appending and reading. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.txt', 'a+')

7.Binary Read ('rb'):

Opens the file for reading in binary mode. Used for binary files like images, videos, etc.
Example: open('file.bin', 'rb')

8.Binary Write ('wb'):

Opens the file for writing in binary mode. If the file exists, its content is truncated. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.bin', 'wb')

9.Binary Append ('ab'):

Opens the file for appending in binary mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.bin', 'ab')

10.Binary Read and Write ('rb+'):

Opens the file for both reading and writing in binary mode. The file must exist.
Example: open('file.bin', 'rb+')

11.Binary Write and Read ('wb+'):

Opens the file for both writing and reading in binary mode. If the file exists, its content is truncated. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.bin', 'wb+')

12.Binary Append and Read ('ab+'):

Opens the file for both appending and reading in binary mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one.
Example: open('file.bin', 'ab+')

These modes provide flexibility for various file operations, allowing you to read, write, append, and handle binary data effectively.
